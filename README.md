# UdacityVRApartment
by Alex Georgescu

## Versions
Unity Version: Unity 2017.1.0p4
GVR Version: GVR Unity SDK v1.60.0

## Additional Information
### Time taken
About 10 hours

### What I liked about the project
Learned a lot about lighting

Contextual clicks (spin cube if looking at it, teleporter otherwise)

### Greatest challenge 
Get the project to work on both daydream and cardboard (I prefer daydream for my eyes, so don't use my cardboard much). Google VR SDK changes all the time!!!
